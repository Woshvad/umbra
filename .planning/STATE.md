# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-25)

**Core value:** The privacy money shot — three desks submit sealed orders blind to each other, an AI solver clears them at one uniform price ($100.00 on the §4 fixture), and the whole batch settles atomically in a single Canton transaction.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — Privacy Proof (Vertical Slice)

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (Privacy Proof (Vertical Slice)) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-25 -- Phase 03 execution started

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~3 min
- Total execution time: 0.2 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 3 | ~10 min | ~3 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (2 min), 01-02 (~2 min), 01-03 (~6 min)
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02 P01 | 4 min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 02 P02 | 10 min | 2 tasks | 4 files |
| Phase 02 P03 | 5 min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 03 P01 | 3min | 2 tasks | 2 files |
| Phase 03 P02 | 9min | 4 tasks | 16 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build on Daml 2.x line via `daml start`; Canton LocalNet / Daml Finance are §19 stretch (deferred past P7).
- [Roadmap]: Standard mode (horizontal layers) — early phases are ledger-only with no UI; vertical slice emerges at P3.
- [Roadmap]: Ship the privacy→clear→settle slice by end of Phase 3 even if everything after is rough.
- [01-01 / LEDG-04]: Daml SDK pinned to **2.10.4** in `daml/daml.yaml` (version gate passed) — recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.
- [01-01]: API line = Daml 2.x HTTP JSON API on :7575, NOT Daml 3.x / cn-quickstart (stretch §19).
- [01-01]: `daml.yaml` uses `source: .` (folder containing `Umbra/`); no `codegen:` block in P1; frontend (P3) installs `@daml/react@2.10.4` with `--legacy-peer-deps`.
- [01-02]: Six §7 templates frozen verbatim across `Asset.daml`/`Auction.daml`/`Roles.daml`; signatory/observer sets are the privacy control (Order has NO observer; TradeConfirmation observes singular `desk`) — no stray observers.
- [01-02]: `Round.Clear` is a signature-frozen compiling placeholder (real verify+DvP body = Phase 2); `ClearResult` defined as a minimal record (spec §7.4 left it undefined).
- [env]: Daml 2.10.4 installed at `%APPDATA%\daml`; invoked as bare `daml` via `~/bin/daml` shim (system PATH lacks `%APPDATA%\daml\bin`); `daml build` verified working on this Windows machine.
- [Phase ?]: [02-01]: §8 clearing math in dedicated pure Umbra/Clearing.daml; rationByPriority top-level recursive (Daml-LF forbids recursive local bindings).
- [Phase ?]: [02-02 / D7]: Round.Clear uses additive Option-B fields; Side/Allocation relocated to leaf Clearing + re-exported (byte-identical).
- [02-03]: Round.Clear retires settled Orders via an operator-only consuming Order.Retire choice, NOT the built-in `archive` (archive needs every signatory's authority — operator AND desk — which operator-authority-only Clear lacks).
- [02-03]: Settlement tests use a parameterised seedAndClose (B BONDX 20.0 funded / 5.0 underfunded) returning a SeedResult of the Option-B ContractIds; atomicity proven by submitMustFail + sorted before/after Asset snapshot equality.
- [Phase ?]: [03-01]: Privacy proven on-ledger by per-party query @T (test_privacy_orders PRIV-01/02/04 + test_privacy_confirmations PRIV-03); pure additions, no template observer changed (privacy is structural from Phase 1).
- [Phase ?]: [03-01 / CLEAR-01]: seedOpenRound leaves Round status=Open and SEEDS RoundStats{count=3}; live lifecycle + solver auto-increment deferred to Phase 4. Frontend money-shot live state, solver-free.
- [Phase ?]: Generated bindings package is @daml.js/umbra-0.1.0 (import from /lib/Umbra/*)
- [Phase ?]: Zero-dep node:crypto HS256 JWT minting (no jsonwebtoken); operator token to scripts/.operator-token, never web/src (T-03-06)

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [P1 gate]: RESOLVED (01-01) — Daml SDK 2.10.4 detected, pinned in `daml/daml.yaml`, and recorded in `DECISIONS.md` with the Daml 2.x HTTP JSON API line + React-18 `--legacy-peer-deps` note.
- [P5 flag]: Confirm GA structured outputs (`output_config.format`) for the Anthropic account/region; wire forced-tool-use fallback if disabled.
