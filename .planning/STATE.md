# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-25)

**Core value:** The privacy money shot — three desks submit sealed orders blind to each other, an AI solver clears them at one uniform price ($100.00 on the §4 fixture), and the whole batch settles atomically in a single Canton transaction.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — Skeleton & Version Gate

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (Skeleton & Version Gate) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3 (01-01, 01-02 complete)
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-06-25 -- Plan 01-02 complete (six §7 templates frozen, daml build green)

Progress: [███████░░░] 67%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build on Daml 2.x line via `daml start`; Canton LocalNet / Daml Finance are §19 stretch (deferred past P7).
- [Roadmap]: Standard mode (horizontal layers) — early phases are ledger-only with no UI; vertical slice emerges at P3.
- [Roadmap]: Ship the privacy→clear→settle slice by end of Phase 3 even if everything after is rough.
- [01-01 / LEDG-04]: Daml SDK pinned to **2.10.4** in `daml/daml.yaml` (version gate passed) — recorded in `DECISIONS.md`.
- [01-01]: API line = Daml 2.x HTTP JSON API on :7575, NOT Daml 3.x / cn-quickstart (stretch §19).
- [01-01]: `daml.yaml` uses `source: .` (folder containing `Umbra/`); no `codegen:` block in P1; frontend (P3) installs `@daml/react@2.10.4` with `--legacy-peer-deps`.
- [01-02]: Six §7 templates frozen verbatim across `Asset.daml`/`Auction.daml`/`Roles.daml`; signatory/observer sets are the privacy control (Order has NO observer; TradeConfirmation observes singular `desk`) — no stray observers.
- [01-02]: `Round.Clear` is a signature-frozen compiling placeholder (real verify+DvP body = Phase 2); `ClearResult` defined as a minimal record (spec §7.4 left it undefined).
- [env]: Daml 2.10.4 installed at `%APPDATA%\daml`; invoked as bare `daml` via `~/bin/daml` shim (system PATH lacks `%APPDATA%\daml\bin`); `daml build` verified working on this Windows machine.

### Pending Todos

[From .planning/todos/pending/ — ideas captured during sessions]

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

[Issues that affect future work]

- [P1 gate]: RESOLVED (01-01) — Daml SDK 2.10.4 detected, pinned in `daml/daml.yaml`, and recorded in `DECISIONS.md` with the Daml 2.x HTTP JSON API line + React-18 `--legacy-peer-deps` note.
- [P5 flag]: Confirm GA structured outputs (`output_config.format`) for the Anthropic account/region; wire forced-tool-use fallback if disabled.

## Deferred Items
